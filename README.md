ConedaKOR allows you to store arbitrary documents and interconnect them with
relationships. You can build huge semantic networks for an unlimited amount of
domains.

## Features ##

* Instead of filling countless lists with your metadata, shape it as
  **entities** within a graph ... never repeat yourself!
* Add **relationships** between your entities
* A carefully designed user interface
* Upload any kind of **media** (pictures, video, spreadsheets, …), also many at
  a time
* Images and videos are automatically converted for playback on the web
* Define which **kind** of entities can be related by what **relations**
* Put your entities in one or many **groups** and share them with other users
* A Fine-grained permission system with **user groups** and entity
  **collections**
* Easy extension of the schema for every kind of entity: Add fields for all
  entities of a specific kind or occasionally add data to arbitrary entities
* Tagging with autocomplete and sensible permissions
* Full text search through all your metadata
* A rich API facilitating additional frontends and data harvesting
* Excel import and export
* Deliver one-click zip downloads to your users
* Identify isolated entities
* Merge entities to further normalize your data
* External authentication (for example LDAP) by simple shell scripts
* Many configurable aspects (welcome page, terms of use, help, primary
  relations, brand, …)
* Vagrant dev environment
* good unit and integration test coverage


## Documentation

These instructions are intended for system operators who wish to deploy the 
software for their users.

### Deployment

Before we go into the details of the deployment process, **please be sure to
backup the database and the `$DEPLOY_TO/shared` directory**. In practice, this
is achieved by dumping the database to a file and creating a snapshot of the VM
that contains the above directory.

ConedaKOR includes a deployment script `deploy.sh` that facilitats installs and
upgrades via SSH. It is a plain bash script that connects to the server
remotely, deploys the code to the specified directory and runs the necessary
tasks (compiling assets, starting background jobs, …). The functionality does
not include the installation of requirements, provisioning of a database server
nor the setup of a web server, since those differ greatly from server to server.

The script expects a directory `$DEPLOY_TO` on the server where it has write
permissions. Within, it will create two subdirectories `$DEPLOY_TO/releases` and
`$DEPLOY_TO/shared`. For every deployment, a subdirectory will be created within
`releases` containing the ConedaKOR code. Data that is supposed to remain
unchanged by deployments resides in `$DEPLOY_TO/shared`. Symlinks are used to
connect the current code with the permanent data. Finally, a symlink
`$DEPLOY_TO/current` will point to the current code so that your (e.g.
passenger) web server configuration can use `DEPLOY_TO/current/public` as
document root.

The script is configured by a config file `deploy.config.sh`, which could look
something like this:

    #!/bin/bash

    export KEEP=5
    export PORT="22"

    function instance01 {
      export HOST="app@node01.example.com"
      export PORT="22"
      export DEPLOY_TO="/var/storage/host/kor"
      export COMMIT="v1.9"
    }

    function instance02 {
      export HOST="deploy@node02.example.com"
      export DEPLOY_TO="/var/www/rack/kor"
      export COMMIT="master"
    }

HOST, PORT and DIRECTORY are self-explanatory. COMMIT defines the commit, branch
(head) or tag that is going to be deployed and KEEP let's you configure how many
previous deployments are going to be kept.

`deploy.config.sh` is run by the `deploy.sh` using the first parameter passed to
itself, so a call

    ./deploy.sh instance02

would deploy to instance02 according to the configuration above. On terminals 
that support it, the output is colorized according to the exit code of every
command issued by the script.

#### Generating a virtual appliance

Versions after and including 1.9.2 can be packaged into a virtualbox appliance
automatically. The version is specified as a shell parameter:

    ./deploy/build.sh 1.9.2

The ova file and a checksum are generated within `deploy/build/`.

### Command line tool

The kor command provides access to functionality which is not easily provided 
from a web page. For example, the excel export potentially generates many large
files which are impractical to download. You may call the command like
this

    bundle exec bin/kor --help

from within the ConedaKOR installation directory to obtain a detailed
description of all the tasks and options.

#### Excel import and export

Please refer to the command line tool for available command line options. In
principle, the export produces seceral spreadsheets containing all entities.
Those sheets may be modified and imported later on.

* identification columns (id and uuid) are not imported: they are only used to
  identify existing records on imports. Leave empty when adding new data.
* the deleted column is not imported: enter any non-empty value in order to
  delete the entity on import.
* timestamps are not imported: they will be changed if the entity will be
  changed by the import.

### Development

The easiest way to get started hacking on kor, is to use the included vagrant
test environment. For now, you can create it with

    vagrant up

SSH into the resulting virtual machine and start the development server:

    vargant ssh
    ...
    bundle exec rails s

This uses the code from the current working directory on your dev machine. Go to
http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the development page.

#### Running the test suites

There are two test suites, rspec unit tests and cucumber integration tests.
Change to the /vagrant directory within the dev VM first and then run
the unit tests:

    bundle exec rspec spec/

or the integration tests:

    bundle exec cucumber features/

Be aware that this will spawn a real browser to conduct the tests, If you prefer
headless testing, you may use phantomjs by setting an environment variable:

    HEADLESS=true bundle exec cucumber features/
